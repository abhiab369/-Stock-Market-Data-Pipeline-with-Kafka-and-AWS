# Stock Market Data Pipeline with Kafka and AWS

Welcome to the Stock Market Data Pipeline project! ðŸ“ˆðŸš€

### Overview
This project showcases the creation of a resilient data pipeline for real-time stock market data using Kafka as the messaging system. The producer code efficiently collects and streams data, while the consumer code processes and stores it in Amazon AWS S3. Analytical queries are seamlessly executed using Amazon Athena, and ETL processes are orchestrated with AWS Glue. Dive into the heart of financial data management with this comprehensive solution.

### Project Structure
- Python script for the Kafka producer, collecting and streaming real-time stock market data.
  
- Python script for the Kafka consumer, processing and storing data in Amazon AWS S3.
